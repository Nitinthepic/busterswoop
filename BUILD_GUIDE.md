# Arkenswoop build guide

## Non hotswap version

**Important**: the soldered MCU jumper pads should be on the same side as the switches, encoder and MCU ; the diodes should be on the back on the PCB.

1. put your PCBs in front of you, one on each side
2. solder the jumper pads on the top: this will be the side where the keys are
    * be careful to solder the jumper pads for the **encoder** on the back!
3. (optional) put the MCU sockets and tape them so that they won't move
    *  if you don't have sockets you can skip this step ; however note that you will have to permanently solder your MCU
4. put the TRRS jack and tape it
5. flip over the PCBs and solder the TRRS jack and sockets (optional)
    * to make it easier, first solder the corners of the sockets, and ensure everything is aligned correctly before going any further
6. for each diode footprint, solder one pad
7. take a diode, which the mark being on the same side as the silk on the PCB, put it over a pad you have tinned, and heat the pad ; the diode should stay in place nicely
8. solder the other leg of the diode
9. repeat 7 -> 8 for every other diode
    * if you have trouble putting diodes near each other, try holding them by their legs which twizzers
10. flip your board over, and start placing your switches ; be careful not to bend any pin
    * the switches should stay in place, without any tape
11. solder your switches: your iron should be in contact with both the pad and the pin, then put your solder on the pad and it will melt easily
12. put the encoder and solder its pins in the same fashion
